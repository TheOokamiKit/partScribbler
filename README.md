# partScribbler
A tool to process MAV part data to a usable spreadsheet format

To use:
Run the python script in terminal/command line with the local path to the part data in php format as the second argument.

IE: python3 main-updated.py parts_0_8_4_7.txt

The part data can be found from Rak Sal Ind. website here: https://www.raksal.com/stats/allstats.php (Note: you will need to save the data to a local file for processing as the script does not support a web address currently)
